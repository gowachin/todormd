This package allow you to add todonotes based on the latex package (todonotes) in both html and pdf rmarkdown documents. For now it only display very simples todonotes but there is a lot to add for later versions.


Feel free to participate to this project, it is designed to be open source under a [CECILL-2 Licence](https://github.com/gowachin/todormd/blob/master/LICENCE-CECILL-2.1.txt). Any help in is welcome (see end of README).

## Installation

### Dependencies

This package relies on very few packages listed below, that you can install with the following code.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (i in c('knitr', 'rmarkdown') ){
  if(!require(i,character.only = TRUE))
    install.packages(i)
}
```

### Development version

You can install the development version of `{todormd}` from [github](https://github.com/gowachin/todormd) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/gowachin/todormd')
# or 
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gowachin/todormd")
```

## Usage

To add todonotes in a markdown, you need to add a chunk where you load the package (it can be hidden with `echo = FALSE` option).

```{r setup}
library(todormd)
```

Then in the document you need to add inline code calling the `todo()` function like below.

```
`r knitr::inline_expr('todo("For example this is a quick note")')` 
```

As github only use markdown syntax, this example is not visible here. However it works on Vignettes : read [Using {todormd} package](https://gowachin.github.io/todormd/articles/dev_todonotes.html) Vignette to learn more about the function options.


## Want to help ?

Go check the [projects](https://github.com/gowachin/todormd/projects) of this repository ! Any help is welcome and I accept all sort of ideas for future project. The idea of this package is to learn about process of rmarkdown knitting and rendering. If you want to use a specific model, join me and we can try to implement it !

Feel free to fork this, and use it. Any recommendation is welcome :)
