I don't know how I'll do this but this could be neat. I'll need some stuff from this book to understand how to do this.

Final objective is to code todonotes like in the latex package.

## Installation

### Dependencies

This package relies on very few packages listed below, that you can install with the following code.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (i in c('knitr', 'rmarkdown') ){
  if(!require(i,character.only = TRUE))
    install.packages(i)
}
```

### Development version

You can install the development version of `{todormd}` from [github](https://github.com/gowachin/todormd) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/gowachin/todormd')
# or

```


## Want to help ?

Go check the [projects](https://github.com/gowachin/todormd/projects) of this repository ! Any help is welcome and I accept all sort of ideas for future project. The idea of this package is to learn about process like desaturation models and turn them into algorithms. If you want to use a specific model, join me and we can try to implement it !

Feel free to fork this, and use it. Any recommendation is welcome :)
